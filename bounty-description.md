Overview
AI agents on Solana are becoming autonomous participants in the ecosystem. For these agents to act independently, execute trades, manage liquidity, or interact with dApps, they need wallets that they control. Agentic wallets are wallets designed specifically for AI agents: capable of signing transactions, holding funds, and interacting with protocols without human intervention.

This bounty focuses on creating a prototype AI agent wallet that demonstrates autonomous transaction capabilities in a secure, sandboxed environment.


Requirements

Your submission must include:

A working agentic wallet that can:

Create a wallet programmatically

Sign transactions automatically

Hold SOL or SPL tokens

Interact with a test dApp or protocol

A deep dive explaining wallet design, security considerations, and how it interacts with AI agents (video or written)

Open-source code with clear README and setup instructions

Can be built solo or with a team of up to 4 developers

Add a SKILLS.md file for agents to read

Working prototype on devnet is required


What You Can Build

Possible directions:

An autonomous wallet that executes scripted trades for a test DeFi protocol

Wallet integrated with a local AI agent simulation (e.g., trading bot, liquidity provider)

Test harness showing multiple agents each managing their own wallets

Optional front-end or CLI to observe agent wallet actions


Technical Expectations

Safe key management and storage for autonomous agents

Automated transaction signing without manual input

Ability to simulate decision-making or execution by an AI agent

Clear separation of responsibilities between agent logic and wallet operations


Judging Criteria

Functional demonstration of an autonomous agent wallet

Security and proper key management

Clear documentation and deep dive explanation

Scalability: support multiple agents independently
